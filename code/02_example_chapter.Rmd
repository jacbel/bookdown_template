# Test Chapter

This is the first chapter. You can treat the chapters as individual R Markdown files. You can write text that explains what is going on in the code and format it using R markdown syntax (Cheat sheet for quick start [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/master/rmarkdown.pdf))

Your code goes into code chunks.

```{r}
a <- 1
b <- 2
c <- a + b
c
```

And you can print things from your R chunks:

```{r}
summary(mtcars)
```

And cool figures via R chunks

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=cyl, y=mpg, color=gear)) +
    geom_point()
```
